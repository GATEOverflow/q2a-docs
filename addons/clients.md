# Question2Answer Clients

[Q2Andy](https://appsmata.github.io/Q2Andy/) by [JacksiroKe](https://question2answer.org/qa/user/jacksiroke) is a new Android client for Question2Answer sites which uses qa-api, a simple Q2A custom API. To use Q2Andy, build [qa-android](https://github.com/Appsmata/qa-android) android app for your site using Android Studio as per your needs then clone [qa-api](https://github.com/Appsmata/qa-api) to the root directory of your Q2A site.

Older Android clients include: [Q2A client for Android](https://github.com/NoahY/q2android) by [NoahY](http://www.question2answer.org/qa/user/NoahY) and [Q2A Android client](https://github.com/arjunsuresh/qaoverflow) by [Arjun](http://gateoverflow.in/user/Arjun/). Both require the [XML-RPC](https://github.com/arjunsuresh/q2a-xml-rpc) plugin to be installed on the Q2A site you're using with permission given to users in Admin page.
