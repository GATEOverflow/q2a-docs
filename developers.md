# Question2Answer has deep support for developers.

This section explains the ways in which Q2A can be integrated and extended:

*   Integrate with your user database using [single sign-on](install-single-sign-on.html) (requires PHP programming).
*   Translate Q2A into [another language](developers-translate.html) using a text editor or customize selected [URLs or phrases](developers-translate.html).
*   Create your own [visual themes](developers-themes.html) using CSS. You may also make changes to the HTML using [advanced themes](developers-themes.html).
*   Access Q2A from [external PHP code](developers-external.html). See also a list of [useful functions](developers-functions.html) in Q2A.
*   Develop a [plugin](developers-plugins.html) for Q2A (also see [tutorial](developers-plugins-tutorial.html)). Plugins can include [modules](developers-modules.html), [layers](developers-themes.html) and/or [overrides](developers-overrides.html).

You can also contribute to the Question2Answer core by issuing pull requests [on Github](https://github.com/q2a/question2answer).
